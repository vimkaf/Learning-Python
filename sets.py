#A set is kinda like a list but cannot have duplicate values

sample_number_set = {5,56,56,2,8,35,8,8,89}

sample_string_set = {'Coding','movies','travelling','fun','coding','Programming','football','Coding'} #my hobbies

print(sample_number_set) #it removes the duplicate and kinda sorts it in a weird way

print(sample_string_set) #it also does the same but doesnt differentiate between Coding and coding
